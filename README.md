## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make decisions. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that aims to find the best move for the AI while assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique that reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm.

## Demo

You can play a live demo of the game [here](https://github.com/shiroul/TicTacToe-AlphaBetaPrune.git).

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
- AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimal moves.
- Interactive user interface for gameplay.
- Clear display of game outcomes (win, lose, draw).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have a modern web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shiroul/TicTacToe-AlphaBetaPrune.git

2. Open HTML file:

   Open the project directory and navigate to the HTML file in your web browser.

### Usage

- Open the HTML file in your web browser using theinstructions provided in the "Installation" section.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the AI opponent.
- Make your move by clicking on the grid where you want to place your symbol (X or O).
- The AI will respond with its move.
- Continue playing until the game is won, lost, or ends in a draw.

### Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
The Minimax algorithm is enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning, an optimization technique that helps reduce the number of nodes explored in the game tree. This makes the AI's decision-making process more efficient, especially in scenarios where certain branches can be discarded without affecting the final decision.
